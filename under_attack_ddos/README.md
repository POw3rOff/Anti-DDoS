# Under Attack DDoS Defense System

This project implements a modular, scalable, defensive Anti-DDoS system for Linux servers, designed to detect and mitigate attacks across multiple network layers.

## Project Structure

- **layer3/**: Network layer defenses. Handles IP-level filtering, ICMP flood protection, and lower-level packet inspection.
- **layer4/**: Transport layer defenses. Focuses on TCP (SYN floods, connection limits) and UDP (amplification attacks) mitigation.
- **layer7/**: Application layer defenses. Analyzes HTTP/HTTPS traffic, API request patterns, and user behavior to stop L7 floods.
- **correlation/**: Cross-layer correlation engine. Connects events from L3, L4, and L7 to identify complex, multi-vector attack campaigns.
- **intelligence/**: Brain of the system. Contains risk scoring algorithms and decision engines to determine when to trigger mitigations.
- **mitigation/**: Active response scripts. Executes system changes such as firewall rule updates, service rate limits, or blackholing.
- **orchestration/**: System control. Manages the "UNDER ATTACK" mode, coordinating the activation and deactivation of defense modules.
- **observability/**: Monitoring and logging. Handles metric collection, log aggregation, and provides data for dashboards.
- **config/**: Configuration management. Stores all system settings in YAML format for easy tuning and deployment.
- **logs/**: Runtime logs. Stores operational logs generated by the system during execution.
- **runtime/**: Runtime state. Holds ephemeral data like PID files, IPC sockets, and temporary state flags.

## Usage

This system is designed as a collection of independent CLI tools orchestrated to work together. Configuration is managed centrally in the `config/` directory.
