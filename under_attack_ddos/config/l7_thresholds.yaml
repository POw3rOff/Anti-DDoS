# Layer 7 Detection Thresholds

# Request Rate Limiting (per IP)
max_rpm_per_ip: 120              # 2 requests/sec average
burst_tolerance: 10              # Allow 10 requests in 1 second

# Hot Resource Protection (Global)
max_rpm_per_resource: 2000       # Alert if a single URL gets hit > 2000 times/min
monitored_endpoints:
  - "/login"
  - "/api/v1/search"
  - "/register"

# Slow Attack Detection
min_data_rate: 10                # Bytes/sec. Connections slower than this are suspicious.
max_connection_duration: 60      # Seconds.
